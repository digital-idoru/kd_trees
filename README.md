kd_trees
========

A simple Python implementation of k-d trees as described by Bently in his paper. kd-trees are a k-dimensional binary tree used for space partitioning and multidimensional queries on tuples. The kd-tree supports varies functionality, such as partial match queries and more. 

I'm implmentating them based off Bently's original paper.
